= Introduction (`sections/2_introduction.typ`)

This is a introductory section included from the main file `thesis.typ` but written inside `sections/2_introduction.typ`. Note that you will need to manually handle function import via the following header:
```typst
#import "../template/template.typ": *
```
You might as well import only functions you would like to use.
